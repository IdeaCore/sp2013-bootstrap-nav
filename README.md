SharePoint / Office 365 Client Side Navigation - Version 0.1 - 10/1/2015

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
--------------------
This code is specifically written to work on SharePoint 2013 on-prem, sandbox or Office 365. The purpose of this code is to replace the standard SharePoint navigation with a navigation that is Bootstrap v3 friendly. At this point it has not been fully tested to work in all possible navigation scenarios. It currently only supports 2 levels of navigation. The navigation can still be manipulated via the standard SharePoint interface.

** IT IS STILL IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT CONSIDERED COMPLETE **
	
HOW TO USE
-----------
It's very simple to use. 
1) Add a link to the topNavigation.js file in your SharePoint masterpage.
2) Add the html snippet into the masterpage in the location you want the navigation to appear.
